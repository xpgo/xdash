# xdash

This is a project copied from [Simple-dash](https://github.com/kutyla-philipp/simple-dash).

I made some changes to the original project for personal usage:

- add search bar
- add text for each icon

# Simple-dash

A simple, fully responsive Dashboard to forward to the services of your choice! Ideal for Desktop and mobile usage!
Add all of your services, whether you host them yourself or not and display them as neat Icons from the FontAwesome libary.
simple-dash is made to be as simple and minimalistic as possible. (The goal was to create a dashboard even my mom could use!) :)
Based on: https://github.com/thetomester13/homepage

This project uses:
- Font Awesome
- Trianglify
